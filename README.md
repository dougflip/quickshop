This is barely anything at this point. Basically trying to get _something_
to take to the store this weekend and try out.

The idea at this point is to manage selections from a static list in local storage.
This should allow me to select items and mark them off as I put them in my cart.

I am sure there are many versions of this that already exist.
Eventually, the hope is to customize this to my exact needs.
